Digital Reasoning’s cognitive computing platform allows it to correlate insights from unstructured data with structured data sources, Thus enhancing the firms overall performance and data management.

## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
 Include on its technology Conduct Surveillance an anonymous-activity-reporting technique which allows people to report questionable or suspectable behaviors they notice from others or speak up when being under threat of losing or forcefully sharing financial or non-financial critical and confidential information.
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
It would assist in bringing light to many underground activities or abusive acts by exploiting insider or outsider information as many activities take place behind computers and way beyond technological reach. Thus, incorporating the human aspect with the technological breakthroughs often leads to tremendous results.
 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
With an encrypted link that guarantees the reporter’s privacy and  anonymity, such a proposal would not require exceptional or remarkably advanced technology as it can start with deploying smart phones, tablets and iPads, social media platforms or professionally implement it through employee access portals. However, it must ensure that the link or portal directs the employee or person to an encrypted platform that cannot track the reporter. 
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
The most important aspect about this service is the timely accessibility of reporters, as very often these suspicious acts occur instantly and call for a prompt response. In another situation the reporter might either be uncertain or too terrorized to share the incident or act and suddenly takes the decision to finally expose a sketchy behavior or suspicious party. Thus, a reporting portal crucially needs to be present for all contingent scenarios.
